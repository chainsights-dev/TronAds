The problem we want to solve is the trust crisis and resource inefficiency in the advertising industry.

The centralized model makes the information in the advertising industry lake of transparency. This transparency problem seriously damages the interests of advertisers. In 2017, ad fraud for digital advertising is over $16B. Most of the profits are overrun by middleman ad exchanges. 

At the same time, advertising resource is inefficiency. More than 90% of the Internet's website traffic is relatively small, and long-tail traffic aggregates account for 15%-25% of Internet traffic, but this part of the resources has not been utilized properly.

We believe that solving the above two problems will greatly improve the efficiency of the advertising industry.
